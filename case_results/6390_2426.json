  "analysis_and_evaluation_of_symptoms": "The case presents a mix of acute and chronic symptoms in a 17-year-old female student. \n**Key Mental Generals (High Rank):** Marked introversion, fear of crowds leading to weeping, significant anxiety (especially pre-exam with physical concomitants like shaking legs, rush of blood to face), and lack of concentration. These deeply represent the patient's individual susceptibility and core disturbance.\n**Key Physical Generals (High Rank):** Ambithermal tending towards chilly (GENERALS; HEAT; vital, lack of), thirstlessness (STOMACH; THIRSTLESSNESS), desire for eggs +++ (GENERALS; FOOD and DRINKS; eggs; desire), desire for spicy food (GENERALS; FOOD and DRINKS; spices; desire). Perspiration on face/hands during anxiety (GENERALS; PERSPIRATION; anxiety, during). Chronic allergic diathesis (GENERALS; ALLERGIC constitution).\n**Characteristic Particulars (Moderate Rank):** \n*   Headache: Recent onset, < AC room, < light, < screen use (mental exertion?), compressing sensation, located over eyebrows, concomitant left ear pain.\n*   Allergy/Coryza: Chronic since childhood, triggered by dust/pollen, manifests as morning sneezing, watery and red eyes.\n**Common Particulars (Lower Rank):** Bowels 2x/day, Urine 7-8x/day (possibly related to anxiety or intake, needs clarification).\n**Guiding Symptoms:** The combination of marked anxiety/fear with specific physical manifestations, strong desire for eggs, thirstlessness, chilly tendency, chronic allergies, and headache modalities (<AC, <Light) form the core totality.",
  "miasmatic_assessment": "The dominant miasm appears to be **Psora**, evident in the functional disturbances, anxiety, fears, lack of concentration, hypersensitivity (allergies, light sensitivity, reaction to AC), and the allergic diathesis itself. A **Tubercular** influence is strongly suggested by the chronicity and severity of allergies since childhood, family history of allergy, desire for spicy food, possible reaction to environmental changes (AC), and underlying anxiety/restlessness (shaking legs). Sycosis might be minimally present (introversion?) but is less prominent. Syphilis is not indicated.",
  "case_type(Acute/Chronic)": "**Acute exacerbation of a Chronic state.** The presenting headache and increased sneezing are acute manifestations. However, they occur against a backdrop of a long-standing chronic allergic condition and a clear constitutional picture (anxiety, introversion, specific generals) indicating an underlying chronic disturbance.",
  "provisional_diagnosis": "**Clinical:** Tension-Type Headache or Migraine variant (triggered by environmental factors/stress), Chronic Allergic Rhinitis with acute exacerbation, possible Generalized Anxiety Disorder features.\n**Homeopathic:** Disturbed Vital Force manifesting primarily through the Psoric and Tubercular miasms, presenting as a chronic allergic diathesis with anxiety and an acute cephalalgia episode.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "**Clinical:** Sinusitis (headache, ear pain, allergy history - but lacks typical sinus pressure/discharge description), Migraine with aura (needs more detail on visual disturbances if any), Eye Strain Headache (from screen use), Cluster Headache (unlikely pattern). \n**Homeopathic:** Conditions primarily driven by pure Psora (less intense allergy/anxiety) or pure Sycosis (different symptom picture).",
  "final_diagnosis": "**Clinical:** Chronic Allergic Rhinitis and Anxiety with Acute Exacerbation presenting as Tension-Type Headache/Migraine variant. \n**Homeopathic:** Chronic Psoro-Tubercular Miasmatic State manifesting as allergic diathesis, anxiety, and acute cephalalgia.",

It also covers aspects of the headache (location) and the underlying allergic/Psoric diathesis. The 200C potency is chosen considering the patient's age (17), clear mental and general symptoms, moderate vitality, functional nature of the complaints, and the chronic underlying state requiring a reasonably deep stimulus. A single dose allows the vital force time to react, adhering to minimum dose principle (Organon ยง246, 272). The Psoro-Tubercular miasmatic background also responds well to Calc Carb."
