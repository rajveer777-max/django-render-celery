  "analysis_and_evaluation_of_symptoms": "The most significant symptoms are the severe, racking cough with soreness and rawness in the chest, hoarseness/aphonia, and involuntary urination on coughing. These are peculiar and characteristic of the case. The modalities of < morning, < warm room/bed, and > cold drinks are important. The cough causing a feeling of 'scraped raw inside' is a strong, peculiar sensation.  The anxiety about involuntary urination is a concomitant symptom. The chilly thermal state, desire for salty snacks, and aversion to sweets are general characteristics to consider.",
